## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- I have learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, including how to utilize CSS custom properties to create reusable and maintainable styles and Flexbox for layout design.
- Learned how to center elements both horizontally and vertically using CSS.

```html
<h1 class="primary-heading fw-bold fs-heading line-height-120 text-color-heading">
  Improve your front-end skills by building projects
</h1>
```
```css
.card {
  --max-width: 320px;
  padding: var(--ps-200) var(--ps-200) var(--ps-500);
  width: min(var(--max-width), 100%);
  margin-inline: auto;
  border-radius: var(--border-radius-medium);
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Continued development

- I want to improve my knowledge of CSS, like flexbox, grid, responsive layouts, etc.
- Improve my HTML knowledge for better semantic HTML, accessibility. Learning features like forms, multimedia, and input types.
